DESCRIPTION                                            *vem-tabline-description*

Vem Tabline is a lightweight plugin that uses Vim's native tabline to display
your tabs and listed buffers at the top of the screen. Buffers are shown to
the left using their names and tabs are numbered and shown to the right. Eg:
>
    | buffer1 | buffer2* | buffer3 |                             | 1 | 2 | 3 |
<
Modified buffers are marked with '*' and identical buffer names are appended
the name of the first different directory names in their path:
>
    | foo | bar@dir1 | bar@dir2 |                                | 1 | 2 | 3 |
<
You can use the normal Vim commands to manage your buffers and tabs and the
tabline will be updated accordingly.

Note: Vem Tabline is a component of a bigger Vim configuration setup named Vem
-still in the works-. Hence the plugin name. In any case, Vem Tabline can be
used totally independently from the Vem project.

==============================================================================
USING WINDOWS                                              *vem-tabline-windows*

Tabs in Vim are used to arrange your windows in different layouts. Buffers are
shared across all tabs and you can have different visualization arrangements
in each tab.

Vem Tabline tries to remain as faithful to this idea as much as possible and
sets the contents of the tabline accordingly:

    * If there's only one window in the tab, all buffers are shown in the
      tabline.

    * If there's more than one window in the tab, only the displayed buffers
      are listed.

For example, if you have 3 buffers: `buffer1`, `buffer2`, `buffer3` and the
tab has two windows showing the first 2 then you will see:
>
    | buffer1 | buffer2 | +1 more                                | 1 | 2 | 3 |
>
However, if there's only one window you'll see the three of them.

==============================================================================
BUFFER ORDER                                          *vem-tabline-buffer-order*

Vem Tabline allows you to change the order in which buffers are shown in each
tab. To do so, use the following <Plug> mappings:

    Move selected buffer to the left:  `<Plug>vem_move_buffer_left-`
    Move selected buffer to the right: `<Plug>vem_move_buffer_right-`

Vim doesn't support ordering buffers natively so if you use `:bnext` and
`:bprev`, they will not follow the order of buffers in the tabline if you have
modified it. To avoid this problem you can use the following mappings:

    Select previous buffer in tabline: `<Plug>vem_prev_buffer-`
    Select next buffer in tabline:     `<Plug>vem_next_buffer-`

For example you could set your mappings like:
>
    nmap <leader>h <Plug>vem_move_buffer_left-
    nmap <leader>l <Plug>vem_move_buffer_right-
    nmap <leader>p <Plug>vem_prev_buffer-
    nmap <leader>n <Plug>vem_next_buffer-
<

COLORS                                                      *vem-tabline-colors*

Vem Tabline uses the default colors of your color scheme for rendering the
tabline. However you may change them using the following highlighting groups:

    Highlighting Group        Default        Meaning~
    *VemTablineSelected*        |TabLineSel|     Selected buffer
    *VemTablineNormal*          |TabLine|        Non selected buffer
    *VemTablineShown*           |TabLine|        Buffer shown in window
    *VemTablineLocation*        |TabLine|        Directory name (when present)
    *VemTablineSeparator*       |TabLineFill|    +X more text
    *VemTablineTabSelected*     |TabLineSel|     Selected tab
    *VemTablineTabNormal*       |TabLineFill|    Non selected tab

For example, to set the selected buffer background to blue in the gui
version of Vim, you could do something like:
>
    highlight VemTablineSelected guifg=White guibg=DarkBlue gui=bold
<
And this is a complete example for a grey colored tabline:
>
    highlight TabLine                    cterm=none ctermfg=255 ctermbg=240 guifg=#242424 guibg=#cdcdcd gui=none
    highlight TabLineSel                 cterm=bold ctermfg=235 ctermbg=255 guifg=#242424 guibg=#ffffff gui=bold
    highlight TabLineFill                cterm=none ctermfg=255 ctermbg=240 guifg=#e6e3d8 guibg=#404040 gui=italic
    highlight VemTablineNormal           cterm=none ctermfg=255 ctermbg=240 guifg=#242424 guibg=#cdcdcd gui=none
    highlight VemTablineSelected         cterm=bold ctermfg=235 ctermbg=255 guifg=#242424 guibg=#ffffff gui=bold
    highlight VemTablineSeparator        cterm=none ctermfg=246 ctermbg=240 guifg=#e6e3d8 guibg=#404040 gui=italic
    highlight VemTablineLocation         cterm=none ctermfg=255 ctermbg=240 guifg=#666666 guibg=#cdcdcd gui=none
    highlight VemTablineLocationSelected cterm=bold ctermfg=235 ctermbg=255 guifg=#242424 guibg=#ffffff gui=bold
    highlight VemTablineTabNormal        cterm=none ctermfg=255 ctermbg=240 guifg=#242424 guibg=#cdcdcd gui=none
    highlight VemTablineTabSelected      cterm=bold ctermfg=235 ctermbg=255 guifg=#242424 guibg=#ffffff gui=bold

SETTINGS                                                  *vem-tabline-settings*

You can set these variables to configure Vem Tabline in your |vimrc| file:

*g:vem_tabline_show*                boolean (default: 1)

    The value of this option specifies how the tabline will be shown:

        0: never shown
        1: shown when there's more than one tab or buffer open
        2: always shown

    Vim option `showtabline` takes these same values but only checks the
    number of tabs and ignores the number of buffers when it is set to 1.
    Please, use `g:vem_tabline_show` instead of `showtabline` since the plugin
    will override the value of the option to fix this behavior.

*g:vem_tabline_multiwindow_mode*    boolean (default: 1)

    When this mode is active, for layouts of multiple windows in the tabpage,
    only the buffers that are displayed in those windows are listed in the
    tabline. That only applies to multi-window layouts, if there is only one
    window in the tabpage, all buffers are listed.

    If this mode is set to 0, all buffers are listed in the tabline regardless
    of the window layout.

*g:vem_tabline_location_symbol*     string (default: @)

    Symbol to use to separate a buffer name from the directory name (eg.
    `buffername@directory`). Only shown in buffers with identical names.

*g:vem_tabline_left_arrow*          string (default: < in terminal, ◀ in gui)

    Symbol to use when there are more buffers to the left of the tabline than
    the ones that fit in it.

*g:vem_tabline_right_arrow*          string (default: > in terminal, ▶ in gui)

    Symbol to use when there are more buffers to the right of the tabline than
    the ones that fit in it.
