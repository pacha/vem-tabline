Vem Tabline
===========

Vem Tabline is a lightweight Vim/Neovim plugin to display your tabs and buffers
at the top of your screen using the editor's tabline.

![Vem Tabline - Screenshot](doc/screenshots/one-window.png)

Vem tabline shows the list of open buffers to the left of the top line
of the screen and tabs as numbered workspaces to the right.

Vem Tabline is a component of [Vem](https://www.vem-editor.org), an alternative
command layout for Vim, but it can be used independently from the Vem project.

Features
--------

* Use of Vim's native tabline (no horizontal splits).

* Support for displaying both buffers and tabs simultaneously.

* Possibility of reordering the buffers in the tabline.

* Support for Vim's native commands (no re-mappings necessary â€”there are
  key mappings offered by the plugin but they are optional).

* Support to show the buffer number together with its name.

* Mouse support for clicking on both buffers (only Neovim) and tabpage numbers.

* Integration with vim-devicons to show file type icons

* Lightweight, performant and just focused on providing the tabline
  functionality.

Installation
------------

You can use Vem Tabline right away without additional configuration. Just
install the plugin and start using it. You only need to configure it if you
want to manually order the buffers in the tabline (explained below) or to show
the buffer number together with its name.

You need at least Vim 7.4 or Neovim to use Vem Tabline.

Note: If you don't have set it yet, probably you may want to specify:
```
set hidden
```
in your `vimrc` file so you can switch buffers without having to save their
changes before.

Moving Buffers in Tabline
-------------------------

Vem Tabline allows you to change the order in which buffers are shown in each
tab. To do so, use the following `<Plug>` mappings:

* `<Plug>vem_move_buffer_left-`: Move selected buffer to the left
* `<Plug>vem_move_buffer_right-`: Move selected buffer to the right

Vim doesn't support ordering buffers natively so if you use `:bnext` and
`:bprev`, they will not follow the order of buffers in the tabline if you have
modified it. To avoid this problem you can use the following mappings:

* `<Plug>vem_prev_buffer-`: Select previous buffer in tabline
* `<Plug>vem_next_buffer-`: Select next buffer in tabline

For example you could set your mappings like:
```
nmap <leader>h <Plug>vem_move_buffer_left-
nmap <leader>l <Plug>vem_move_buffer_right-
nmap <leader>p <Plug>vem_prev_buffer-
nmap <leader>n <Plug>vem_next_buffer-
```
Where leader is typically set to `\` in Vim.

### Deleting Buffers

You can use any Vim command to delete or wipeout your buffers. However, if you
have reordered them, you'll notice that the next buffer to be displayed is not
the next in the tabline, which is not very intuitive. This is because Vim
chooses the next buffer to display from its internal buffer list and not from
the tabline reordered one. If you want to delete a buffer and get the next one
in the tabline selected, use the following keymap:
```
nmap <leader>x <Plug>vem_delete_buffer-
```
If the current buffer has unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to confirm.

Quick access to tabs
--------------------

You may also want to map the numbered keys to quickly access your tabs. To do
so, use the following key mappings:
```
nnoremap <leader>1 :1tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>2 :2tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>3 :3tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>4 :4tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>5 :5tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>6 :6tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>7 :7tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>8 :8tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <leader>9 :9tabnext<CR>
```

Filetype icons
--------------

Vem Tabline integrates with the
[vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) plugin to show, next
to each filename, an icon that displays its file type.

By default, once the plugin is installed, the file type icons will be displayed
automatically. You can prevent this behavior by adding:
`let g:vem_tabline_show_icon = 0` to your `vimrc` file.


Color Scheme
------------

Vem Tabline uses the default colors of your color scheme for rendering the
tabline. However you may change them using the following highlighting groups:

Highlighting Group         | Default     | Meaning
---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
VemTablineNormal           | TabLine     | Non-selected buffers
VemTablineLocation         | TabLine     | Directory name of non-selected buffers (when present)
VemTablineNumber           | TabLine     | Number of non-selected buffers (when present)
VemTablineSelected         | TabLineSel  | Currently selected buffer
VemTablineLocationSelected | TabLineSel  | Directory name of the currently selected buffer (when present)
VemTablineNumberSelected   | TabLineSel  | Number of the currently selected buffer (when present)
VemTablineShown            | TabLine     | Buffers currently being displayed in windows
VemTablineLocationShown    | TabLine     | Directory name of the buffers being displayed (when present)
VemTablineNumberShown      | TabLine     | Number of the buffers being displayed (when present)
VemTablineSeparator        | TabLineFill | '+X more' text
VemTablinePartialName      | TabLine     | Partially displayed buffer at the edge of the tabline
VemTablineTabSelected      | TabLineSel  | Selected tab
VemTablineTabNormal        | TabLineFill | Non selected tab
VemTablineModified         | TabLineFill | Non-selected modified buffers
VemTablineSelectedModified | TabLineSel  | Currently selected modified buffer

For example, with the following code you can configure your tabline colors using
different shades of grey:

```
highlight VemTablineNormal           term=reverse cterm=none ctermfg=0   ctermbg=251 guifg=#242424 guibg=#cdcdcd gui=none

```

Multiwindow mode
----------------

Vem Tabline offers a mode to show only relevant buffers depending on the layout
of the current tabpage:

* In tabs with only one window all buffers are listed.

* In tabs with more than one window, only the buffers that are being displayed
  are listed.

This allows you to have a cleaner list of buffers depending on the tab that is
active and goes well with Vim's philosophy of using tabs as workspaces to
arrange windows in different configurations.

To enable this mode, set `g:vem_tabline_multiwindow_mode` to 1 in your `vimrc`.
See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.


Configuration
-------------

The plugin is pretty simple and doesn't require manual configuration. However,
there are some parameters that you may want to change. The most important ones
are:

`g:vem_tabline_show`: boolean (default: 1)

    The value of this option specifies how the tabline will be shown:

    0: never shown
    1: shown when there's more than one tab or buffer open
    2: always shown

    Note: Vim option `showtabline` is used for the same purpose and takes these
    same values, however it only checks the number of tabs and ignores the
    number of buffers when it is set to 1. Please, use `g:vem_tabline_show`
    instead of `showtabline` since the plugin will override the value of the
    option to fix this behavior.

`g:vem_tabline_multiwindow_mode`: boolean (default: 0)

    When this mode is active, for layouts of multiple windows in the tabpage,
    only the buffers that are displayed in those windows are listed in the
    tabline. That only applies to multi-window layouts, if there is only one
    window in the tabpage, all buffers are listed.

    If this mode is set to 0, all buffers are listed in the tabline regardless
    of the window layout.

`g:vem_tabline_show_number`: string (default: 'none')

    Show number in front of each buffer. The possible values are:

        none: no number is shown
        buffnr: Vim's buffer number is shown
        index: displayed buffers are numbered sequentially starting from 1

    Check the help file to get more information about how to switch to buffers
    using the index number.

For more configuration options, check the [Vim help file](/doc/tabline.txt)
provided with the plugin.

Credits
-------

There are many plugins to display the buffers in Vim. The design of Vem Tabline
is based on two very cool ones:
[vim-buftabline](https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline) and
[WinTabs](https://github.com/zefei/vim-wintabs). It doesn't share code with
them but many ideas come from their original authors.
